# Smarty Sugar for Espresso

Smarty is a PHP Template Engine for designers. Built in LiveStreet and CoGear.

I hate any template engine but use it every day in developing LS skin and skin Sugar is a working solution for Smarty syntax (.tpl files, for example).

Based on the [php-smarty TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/php-smarty.tmbundle) and forked from [prtm](https://github.com/ptrm/)'s [repo](https://github.com/ptrm/Smarty.sugar).

## Known bugs
- smarty highlighting is present inside html tags enclosed by `{literal}`
- custom block functions (e.g. `{textformat}{/textformat}`) won't show in itemizer as a parent node

## Todo
- highlighting for `$smarty` reserved variable and foreach/section variables (`index`, `iteration` etc.)
- auto-completion and highlighting for native variable modifiers
- mark invalid syntax?

Note: it's prtm's TODO, not My (Grawl's)
